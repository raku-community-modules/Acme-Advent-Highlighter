# DESCRIPTION

Preprocessor for Perl 6 Advent Articles, with syntax highlighter. Saves the
trouble of not having to deal with broken escapes in code blocks in Wordpress
and syntax-highlights, as a cherry on top.

# GIST TOKEN

To get the best syntax highlights, the module uses GitHub's Gists for
highlighting. You'll need to
[obtain a GitHub API token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Only
`gist   Create gists` permission is needed.
